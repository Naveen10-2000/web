      <h3>Zero-Day Network Intrusion Detection</h3>
      <p>Zero-Day Network Intrusion Detection refers to the capability of identifying and preventing cyber attacks and intrusions that exploit previously unknown vulnerabilities in software or network systems. It involves detecting and blocking threats in real-time before they can exploit zero-day vulnerabilities, which are unknown to the software vendor or security community. This type of intrusion detection system uses advanced techniques such as anomaly detection, behavioral analysis, machine learning, and threat intelligence to detect and mitigate zero-day attacks. By monitoring network traffic, analyzing patterns, and identifying suspicious activities, a Zero-Day Network Intrusion Detection system helps protect against emerging threats and minimize the potential damage caused by unknown vulnerabilities. </p>
